Assignment Description: The great wizard school of Pogwarts has been adding a lot of new spellbooks to their library lately. As a result of all the new literature some mischievous students have been learning spells that are dangerous. In addition, it has become increasingly difficult for the staff to find specific spells they want to teach in class. In order to alleviate these issues the school administration has hired you to create a spellbook catalog program that will allow for access restriction and make searching for spellbooks easier. To simplify your task, the school has provided you with their spellbook and wizard profile information. These come in the form of two textfiles: wizards.txt and spellbooks.txt. NOTE: The two filenames are provided on the command line and should not be hardcoded in your program! The spellbooks.txt file contains a list of Pogwartsâ€™s spellbooks and their included spells. This file will give you the spellbook and spell information that your program will organize and display. The wizards.txt file contains a listing of all wizards associated with Pogwarts. This file will give your program the information needed to control which spellbooks users can access.
